The term “template” is used in different ways when working with WordPress themes:
1-Templates files exist within a theme and express how your site is displayed.
2-Page Templates are those that apply only to pages to change their look and feel.  A page template can be applied to a single page, a page section, or a class of pages.
3-Template Tags are built-in WordPress functions you can use inside a template file to retrieve and display data (such as the_title() and the_content()).
4-Template Hierarchy is the logic WordPress uses to decide which theme template file(s) to use, depending on the content being requested.

There are five default Post Types readily available to users or internally used by the WordPress installation:
-Post (Post Type: ‘post’)
-Page (Post Type: ‘page’)
-Attachment (Post Type: ‘attachment’)
-Revision (Post Type: ‘revision’)
-Navigation menu (Post Type: ‘nav_menu_item’)
